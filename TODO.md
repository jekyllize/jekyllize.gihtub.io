# TODO

- Handle different versions:
  - GitHub Pages with no custom plugins, on master repo
  - Using Travis with custom plugins, on source repo

- Handle a template upstream repo to manage better derived ones

## Search

- Not enough content in memory for a proper search
- Create a common search template and include customization from an external file

## Localization

- set the `lang` variable globally in `_config.yml` instead each page
- generate default language pages in the `_site` root
